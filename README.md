# LUSC Programming Language
_This is my attempt at creating a programming language from scratch for learning purposes. The idea is to implement as much as possible in pure C, maybe using Flex and Bison. The initial idea is for a scheme-like language, since they are easy do design and implement_

## Description
Being based on scheme/lisp, the language uses traditional S-expressions. Expressions should be fully parenthesized and follow polish/prefix notation. The first goal is to implement a basic REPL, capable of receiving expressions and returning their value.

## Installation
Clone the repository, open bash, type `make install`
